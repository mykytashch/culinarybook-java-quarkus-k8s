# Culinary Book Monorepo

This monorepo houses the codebase for the Culinary Book project, a personal learning endeavor aimed at honing development skills. It is organized into frontend, backend, and shared packages.

## Technologies Utilized

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js for building the user interface.
  - Docker for containerization.

- **Backend:**
  - Quarkus as the backend framework.
  - Docker for containerization.
  - PostgreSQL for database management.

- **Shared:**
  - Libraries and utilities shared between the frontend and backend.

- **Infrastructure:**
  - Kubernetes for orchestration.
  - Helm for managing Kubernetes packages.

- **Testing:**
  - Jest for frontend testing.
  - JUnit for backend testing.

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
  - Utilizing GitLab CI and Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines.

- **Documentation:**
  - Markdown files for detailing API, architecture, contribution guidelines, and user guide.

## Significance of Key Technologies

- **Quarkus:**
  Quarkus is a cutting-edge, Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored for Java virtual machines (JVMs) and native compilation, optimizing Java specifically for containers and enabling it to become an effective platform for serverless, cloud, and Kubernetes environments. By learning and implementing Quarkus, not only is the project aligned with modern development standards, but it also explores efficient backend development optimized for cloud deployment.

- **Kubernetes:**
  Kubernetes is a powerful open-source container orchestration system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Incorporating Kubernetes provides hands-on experience with a highly sought-after technology in the industry, learning how to manage microservices and containerized applications at scale.

- **Java:**
  Java remains a robust, high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language with strong memory management, concurrent execution model, and a wealth of libraries. By building the backend with Java, the project delves into creating scalable, maintainable, and efficient backend systems, which are crucial skills for modern software development.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as a monorepo with three main packages: frontend, backend, and shared. Each package has its specific dependencies, Dockerfile for containerization, and README for detailed instructions.

## Getting Started

Refer to the `USER_GUIDE.md` for instructions on setting up the development environment, building, and deploying the project.
